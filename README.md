# UFO
A classwork example of creating dynamic table on an HTML page using JavaScript.
# Overview
The main goal was to create a table organizing UFO data that was originally stored as a JavaScript array. The table can be filteredbased on date, city, state, country, or shape of the UFO. Using JavaScript integration on an HTML webpage, this website will be available for those who are interested in viewing UFO sighting data easily and quickly.
# Purpose
Adding filts for city, state, country, and shape will make searching the UFO sighting results very user friendly. The goal is to create an easy to use webpage to help our users search for data to help them find specific sightings or aggregate common factors. Filtering for multiple items at the same time will also be beneficial to users who are interested in further analysis of UFO sighting patterns and history.
# Results 
Below I have shown that you can perform a search by typing in a search term to the appropriate filter box and then either selecting the Enter key on the keyboard or left clicking out of the text box. This updates the data table on the webpage to only show results that match the search term:

# Summary
Unfortunately, there are a few things I would change.
- I would add a filter for multiple selections for shape inputs, city and state.
- I also suggest putting Google Form comment box via iFrame. In the webpage description, it states: "So what do YOU think? Are we alone in the universe? Are aliens trying to contact us, or do they want to be left alone? Dig through the data yourself, and let us know what you see." I would like to see some feedback from users who visit the webpage.
